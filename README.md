# 591 Project Proposal

1. My project will focus on optimal Triangulation of polygons. 
2. I will start by programming a clear implementation and use the methods
studied to transform recursive algorithms into incremental iterative ones. 
3. I will use this method to derive an efficient implementation that is still
clear. So I will start with a O(n^2), "ear-clipping" method then use that code
to create a clear version of the O(n^2) ear clipping algorithm. 
4. I will test the clear and efficient solutions on increasingly large polygon
test case. I will compare my code to the code from Joseph
O'rourke's
[Computation Geometry in C Code](http://cs.smith.edu/~orourke/books/ftp.html)
which has O(n^2) ear clipping code in C and Java.
